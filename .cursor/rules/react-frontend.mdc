# Frontend React Conventions

## Components
- Use function components only. Prefer React 18+ patterns (e.g. `useId`, Suspense where useful).
- Colocate component-specific styles or use the project’s chosen system (Material-UI or Tailwind).
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks under `frontend/src/hooks/`. Keep components focused on UI.

## State and Data
- Use Redux Toolkit or Zustand as per README. Use the WebSocket client for real-time market data; keep subscription logic in hooks or services.
- Fetch via `frontend/src/services/` API clients. Handle loading and error states in the UI.

## Charts and Perf
- Use D3.js for complex financial charts (candlesticks, volume, indicators); Recharts/Plotly where appropriate.
- Aim for chart render under 500ms for 1000+ points (virtualize or downsample if needed). Avoid unnecessary re-renders (memo, stable callbacks).

## TypeScript
- Type props and hook return values. Prefer shared types from a central types file or from API contract (e.g. OpenAPI-generated) when available.
